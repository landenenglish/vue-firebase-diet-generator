A project I'm building on and refactoring over time as I learn Vue.js

# vue-firebase-diet-generator

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
